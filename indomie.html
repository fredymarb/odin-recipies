    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indomie is an authentic past time meal enjoyed by most Ghanaians.</p>
    <p>This noodle is packed with all the necessary ingredients that are needed for preparing it. But I just like to add either all or some of the ingredients listed below.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced Onions</li>
        <li>Fresh pepper</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>50ml vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pieces the indomie in a bowl and pour boiled water into it, allowing for about five minutes for the noodles to get soft.</li>
        <li>Set your frying pan on the heat, add sliced tomatoes, onions, fresh pepper, and fry for about five minutes as well.</li>
        <li>
            Break the two eggs into the same bowl containing the noodles and stir together, then transfer to the frying pan.

The frying pan contains the fried tomatoes onions and peppers, cook and stir for about five minutes, and you are done.

You just made one of my favorite Ghanaian breakfasts, serve with cold soft drinks.
